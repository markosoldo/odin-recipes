          and cheesy pepperoni toppings. This is a special pizza you've never
          had before! It's so easy to make and you can use frozen, freshly
          cooked, or leftover French fries. Great for a game day party or any

            <li>4 cups French fries (frozen or freshly cooked)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>salt and pepper (to taste)</li>

          <h4>For the Toppings:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup marinara sauce (or pizza sauce)</li>
            <li>
              2 cups shredded cheese (I used the mix of mozzarella and Swiss
              cheese)
            </li>
            <li>12-15 pepperoni slices</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Instructions</h2>

          <h4>Make the Crust</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Remove the French fries from the freezer and let them thaw for
              about 5-10 minutes (you don't need to let it thaw completely).
            </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400F and set aside a pizza pan.</li>
            <li>
              In a large mixing bowl, add French fries, then use a fork to mash
              them into smaller pieces.
            </li>
            <li>Add cornstarch, salt, and pepper. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Pour the French fries onto the pizza pan.</li>
            <li>
              Press the pieces together to make the crust. (Make sure to press
              them as much as possible.)
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Add the Toppings</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Add marinara sauce on top of the crust, and spread it out evenly.
            </li>
            <li>Sprinkle the shredded cheese on top of the sauce.</li>
            <li>Add pepperoni slices.</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Bake the Pizza and Serve</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Bake for 15-20 minutes or until the cheese is melted.</li>
            <li>
              Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Serve with
              a pie server and enjoy!
            </li>
          </ol>
