            <p>Part of the secret of a success in life is to eat what you like and let the food fight it out inside. While eating at a restaurant 
                is an enjoyable and convenient occasional treat, most individuals and families prepare their meals at home. To make breakfast, lunch, 
                and dinner daily, these persons must have the required foods and ingredients on hand and ready to go. So you better cut the pizza in 
                four pieces because I'm not hungry enough to eat six.</p>
